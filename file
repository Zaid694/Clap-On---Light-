Overview
The Clap-On Light project allows you to turn a light on or off with the sound of claps. A microphone sensor listens for claps and sends signals to the Arduino, which then toggles a relay module to control the light.

Required Components
Hardware
Arduino Uno (or any compatible microcontroller board)
Microphone Sensor Module (e.g., KY-038 or LM393-based sound sensor)
Relay Module (for controlling high-voltage devices like light bulbs)
Light Bulb or LED (as the output device)
Jumper Wires (male-to-male and male-to-female)
Breadboard (for temporary circuit connections)
Power Source (e.g., USB cable for Arduino or a 5V power supply)
Circuit Diagram
Here’s how to connect everything:

Microphone Sensor:

VCC → Arduino 5V
GND → Arduino GND
OUT → Arduino Digital Pin 2
Relay Module:

VCC → Arduino 5V
GND → Arduino GND
IN → Arduino Digital Pin 3
Connect the Light Bulb to the relay terminals as per the relay module's wiring instructions.
Light Bulb/LED:

Connect one terminal of the bulb/LED to the relay's NO (Normally Open) port and the other terminal to a power source (mains power or DC supply).
How It Works
Microphone Sensor: Detects sound and outputs a HIGH signal when a loud sound (clap) is detected.
Arduino: Monitors the output from the microphone sensor and counts the claps.
Relay Module: Toggles the light on/off based on the Arduino's decision.
